# Cube D3 Agent Platform Integration Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples demonstrating how to integrate the Cube D3 agent platform with other agentic systems via A2A and MCP protocols.

## Overview

Cube D3 is a powerful agent platform that can be integrated with other agent systems to create sophisticated multi-agent workflows. This repository showcases practical integration patterns and implementations.

## Protocols

### A2A (Agent-to-Agent)

The A2A protocol allows direct communication between agents. Examples in this repository demonstrate:
- Basic A2A communication patterns
- Structured data exchange
- Multi-step agent interactions
- Error handling and recovery

### MCP (Multi-Agent Communication Protocol)

**Coming Soon**

The MCP protocol examples will demonstrate:
- Complex multi-agent orchestration
- Dynamic agent discovery
- Federated agent networks
- Advanced communication patterns

## Getting Started

Each example includes:
- Complete source code
- Configuration files
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected outputs

## Requirements

- Node.js (version specified in each example)
- Cube D3 agent platform access
- Agent Inc developer account
