I'll check the data model first to understand the revenue metrics available, then generate a report showing the last 12 months of revenue data. Now I'll create a query to show the revenue data for the last 12 months. I'll use the orders_view and group by month. I've generated a bar chart showing the monthly revenue data for the last 12 months. The chart displays revenue trends from January 2024 through December 2024, with each month's total revenue clearly visualized. 

The data shows some interesting monthly variations, with December 2024 having the highest revenue at approximately $2.5 million, followed by November at about $1.98 million. February 2024 had the lowest revenue of the period at around $967,608.

You can see the seasonal patterns in the visualization, which might help identify trends and inform business planning.
